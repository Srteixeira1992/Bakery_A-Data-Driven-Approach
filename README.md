* Identify trends, seasonal patterns, and key performance indicators.
* Use time series forecasting techniques to predict the last month’s sales.
* Provide actionable insights for business decision-making.

## Tools and Technologies
* Python
* Pandas – Data manipulation and preprocessing
* Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
* Statsmodels – Statistical analysis and trend identification
* Prophet – Time series forecasting

## Key Steps
